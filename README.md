# EchoWiiCLI

This version is compatible with any MultiWii Flight Controllers. I am creating it for the ease
of configuring the flight controller over mobile phone. I saw the EzGUI and thinking maybe is 
good to have a basic command line version. I like command line to configure everything. Is like
configuring routers, networking switch and etc.

## Features:
1. Connectable over USB and Bluetooth [IN PROGRESS]
2. Console feel [DONE]
3. There will be commands for:
   a. PID
   b. Motors
   c. Battery Status
   d. All sensors
   e. AUX Switches
